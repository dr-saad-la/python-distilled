# Text Editors for Python Programming


Text editors play a crucial role in the development of Python programs, offering a lightweight, flexible, and sometimes more efficient way to write code. Unlike full-featured IDEs, text editors are generally faster and consume fewer system resources, making them ideal for quick edits, script writing, and small projects. They can also be expanded with plugins and extensions to add more features, such as autocompletion, syntax highlighting, and integrated terminal support.
